# Grow

Welcome to the website for Grow!

This is built with Gatsby: check out the [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) docs if you haven't worked with it before :).

## Getting started

Run the following commands:

1. `cd grow-website-gatsby`
2. `yarn install`
3. `gatsby develop`

You should then be able to visit http://localhost:8000/

## Deployment

1. `git push origin master:deploy/preview`
2. `git push origin master:deploy/production`

There are currently no tests written. We could also add caching to circleci.
