    "We’re the dedicated, approachable and welcoming team behind Grow. We all work at Springload and have been generously given time and support during our work hours to make Grow what it is.",
    "Not all of us code (but most of us do). And not all of us knew that tech was where we wanted to end up. Some of us came from eclectic, non-coding backgrounds: graphic design, fine art, creative writing, clock repairing, cabinet making, and photography. But what we all want is to help make learning the basics of web development as fun and accessible as we can for you.",

        "Katie started off as a graphic designer, and that background plays a huge part in how she approaches front-end development. She loves working with designers, and is passionate about making the best decisions for the user experience. She learned front-end development at Media Design School in Auckland, and has a passion for building beautiful, scalable UIs with CSS.",

She was quickly snapped up for a permanent position. She’s an experience designer who’s passionate about putting people first — using service, user experience, and user interface design to create digital experiences that make a positive impact for people and the planet.",

        "Usha got her start in coding early. As a young teen, she started playing around with code and it wasn’t long before she discovered the open source community. It impressed her with its wealth of learning resources and culture of building things to help people. After a few years as an apprentice at her dad’s IT business followed by Enspiral Dev Academy’s web development bootcamp, she contracted for a few months before joining Springload as a front-end developer.",

She’s Springload’s studio and events manager, and she loves looking after (and being part of) a team of smart, friendly, vibrant people — which is a real change from working on her own as a photographer! She finds the tech industry exciting and ever-changing, and loves that it has the capacity to incite positive change in the world.",

He started out in the hospitality industry when he was fifteen, and after finishing school worked his way up to management at the Guinness Storehouse in Dublin. That may be a far cry from working at a tech company, but here at Springload he gets to do what he loves most — helping people. From organising food for workshops to getting T-shirts printed for the team, he’s been indispensable in helping run Grow.",

She came to New Zealand on a visa sponsored by Touchtech, which merged with Springload last year. With a background in science and languages, she believes software engineering is like the creative writing of mathematical algorithms. She loves that her role as technical lead allows her to communicate with others while practising her craft, to solve hard problems and help others find solutions to theirs.",

        "Lydie always knew she wanted to solve problems for a living. Programming didn’t occur to her until after she’d studied both clock-repairing (which wasn’t creative enough) and cabinet-making (which was difficult to survive off in her native Paris). After working in hospitality for a few years and tinkering with a blog on the side, she realised that becoming a web developer could be creative, interesting, and viable. She did a bootcamp and an internship, et voilà! — six years later, she’s still a front-end developer, and she still loves it.",

Now a front-end developer pursuing her writing alongside her tech career, she’s excited to have the chance through Grow to work with people from non-STEM backgrounds who might see tech as an intimidating sector to break into.",

Not content to leave these two careers in their own separate silos, she’s excited by the challenge of pushing her art and technology together, and is inspired by artist/developers like Sarah Drasner and Zach Lieberman. Outside of her work at Springload, she’s constantly looking for ways to evolve her art — working on digital animations and interactive pieces, and drawing and coding together.",
