          "How many applicants do you accept, and how many people apply?",

          {__html: "We try to pair two applicants to every coach who’s available. Around twenty applicants fit comfortably in the space Springload has generously let us use. For our first workshop, we received over a hundred applicants."}

        question: "If I’m not accepted for one workshop, can I reapply?",
        answer:
          {__html: "Before we open applications to everyone, we give priority to the applicants who missed out on the last workshop. Even if you miss out the first time, you’ll probably get a chance to attend a later workshop."}

        question:
          "Why a workshop specifically for women and non-binary people?",
        answer:
          {__html: "There’s still a huge gender gap in STEM, and we believe creating spaces for learning to code for those who are underrepresented will help us close that gap. We are all for doing what we can to create a more diverse tech sector!"}

        question: "How much coding experience do I need?",
        answer:

        answer:
          {__html: "You’ll be able to join the Grow Facebook group and keep up with those who have Grown with you. And maybe you’ll decide to keep learning to code by making use of some of the online resources we recommend!"}
